# An Encrypted Client Server Application 
The application is for my Computer Networking(4P14) course. It is a messaging application between multiple clients and a single server. 
The clients can send a text message to the server, and the server will send back an automated response. The message channel is end-end encrypted using the AES 256
encryption algorithm, and implements a diffie-helman key excahnge in order for the channel to be set up with private keys.
